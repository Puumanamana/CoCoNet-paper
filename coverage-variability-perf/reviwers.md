R4: l405: "The importance of accounting for coverage variability along the contigs is critical in viralmetagenomes" - this is conjecture: your results do not show this (please correct me and refer to figure/table if I'm wrong). One way of really showing that the variability is a valuable signal, is by removing the signal and showing that the performance decreases. This could be done by averaging the coverage of the different fragments of each genome, thus making them the same and removing the depth variability as a signal. This would be a very interesting experiment that would allow you to really make the cited statement.
